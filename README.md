# React + Vite

In the blog application I developed using ReactJS, several key features distinguish it:

- Data Storage with Appwrite : I utilized Appwrite for managing and storing data efficiently.
- User Authentication : The application includes robust functionality for user login and logout.
- Blog Creation : Users can create and upload blog posts along with photos. A rich text editor is also integrated to enhance the writing experience.
- Reusable Components : I implemented components that are designed for reuse, adhering to industrial standards.






This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
